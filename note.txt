(With ASCII diagrams + Algorithms)

===================================================================
⭐ 1. Treasure Grab – Competitive BFS Agents
Algorithm Used: BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Agents A and B both search for the nearest coin C.

ASCII Grid Example
. C . . C
. . . C .
A . . . B
. C . . .
C . . C .

Key Concepts

Each agent performs BFS from its current position.

First step in path is chosen → 1-step movement per turn.

If both reach a coin simultaneously → both get a point.

No interference (agents don’t block).

Why BFS?

Because BFS always finds the nearest coin in an unweighted grid.

⭐ 2. Capture the Flag – A* Search AI
Algorithm Used: A* Search with Manhattan Heuristic

Agent Behaviors

If enemy near its flag → DEFEND

Else → ATTACK (move toward enemy flag)

A* computes the optimal path around walls.

Why A*?

Faster than BFS and gives optimal path using heuristic.

⭐ 3. Resource War – Dynamic BFS with Spawning

Every 3 steps, a new resource R spawns.

Both agents use BFS to reach nearest resource.

If both reach same R → both get 1 point.

ASCII Spawn Example
. . R . . . .
. . . . . . .
. . . A . . .

⭐ 4. Smart Snake Duel – Heuristic Snake AI
Algorithm Used:

Safe-move pruning

Distance-based greedy movement

Collision survival logic

Key Features

Snakes move toward food.

Avoid collisions.

Head-on collision winner decided by score.

⭐ 5. Predator–Prey Escape Game
Algorithms Used:

Predator → Random

Prey → Greedy escape (maximizes Manhattan distance)

Anti-oscillation logic

P . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

Win Conditions

Predator catches prey.

Prey survives 50 steps.

⭐ 6. Maze Domination – Territory Expansion AI
Algorithm Used:

Multi-Agent Grid Expansion (Local Neighborhood Search)

. . . # . . .
. # . . . # .
. . . . . . .

Rules

A and B expand into adjacent empty cells.

If both try same cell → mark as X (conflict).

⭐ 7. Competitive Cleaner – BFS Cleaning Bots
Algorithm Used: BFS to nearest dirt cell

Each agent:

⭐ 8. Market Trader Duel – Profit Competition
Agent A Strategy: Momentum

If price going up → buy

If price going down → sell

Agent B Strategy: Mean Reversion

Buy when price < average

Sell when price > average

⭐ 9. Bidding War – Heuristic Auction AI
Agent A: Rule-Based

Expensive items → high bid

Cheap items → low bid

Agent B: Completely Random
ASCII Output Example
Item 3 | Base: 40
A bids: 49
B bids: 72
Winner: B

⭐ 10. Grid Racing AI – A* Race to Goal
Algorithm Used: A*

Agents start on opposite sides and race to the same goal avoiding obstacles.

===================================================================
📘 6. General AI Logic (for Viva)
===================================================================
🎯 Explain BFS in 2 lines:

BFS explores neighbors level by level and always finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

🎯 Explain A* Search:

A* uses
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
to find optimal paths faster than BFS.

🎯 What is a Heuristic?

A function that estimates the cost to reach the goal (ex: Manhattan distance).

🎯 Why use deep copy in Treasure Grab?

To prevent scoring errors by freezing the grid state before agents move.

🎯 Why use greedy logic in Snake & Prey?

Greedy decisions work well in fast-moving competitive environments.

🎯 Why conflict cells marked X in Maze Domination?

To ensure fairness when both agents try to claim the same territory.
